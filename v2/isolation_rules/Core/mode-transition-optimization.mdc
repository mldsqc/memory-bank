# OPTIMIZED MODE TRANSITION

> **TL;DR:** This strategy ensures efficient mode transitions by minimizing token overhead and maximizing context preservation.

```

## üìã CONTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL

When transitioning between modes, only the **critical, relevant context** for the *next* phase should be actively transferred.
**Instructions:**
1.  **Current Mode:** Before exiting, update `tasks.md` with the final status and key outcomes of the completed phase. Summarize critical information for `activeContext.md`.
2.  **Next Mode:** Upon activation, the new mode will:
    *   Read `tasks.md` for overall task status and next steps.
    *   Read `activeContext.md` for immediate focus.
    *   If specialized information is needed (e.g., design decisions in IMPLEMENT mode), load the relevant `creative-*.md` files *on demand*.

## üí° TOKEN EFFICIENCY IN TRANSITIONS

-   **Avoid Full Context Duplication:** Do not copy the *entire* previous mode's working memory.
-   **Leverage Memory Bank Files:** `tasks.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md` serve as the primary persistent context.
-   **Lazy Loading of Detailed Rules:** Only load `creative-*.md` or other detailed rules when explicitly required by the next mode's logic, not upon general mode entry.
-   **Summarization:** Encourage concise summaries in `activeContext.md` or `progress.md` for quick overview rather than full detail copy-pasting.

## üìå TRANSITION MESSAGES

Use these messages to guide the user during transitions:

### Phase Completion & Next Mode Prompt:
```
‚úÖ [Current Phase] Complete
‚û°Ô∏è NEXT RECOMMENDED MODE: [Next Mode Name]

Type '[Next Mode Name]' to proceed.
```

### Context Preservation Confirmation (after new mode activates):
```
Continuing from previous work.
Current task focus: [Summary from activeContext.md]
Task status: [Status from tasks.md]
```

## üö® TRANSITION BLOCKERS

If the `tasks.md` or `activeContext.md` are not in the expected state for the next mode, provide clear instructions:

```
‚õîÔ∏è MODE TRANSITION BLOCKED
Reason: [Explanation, e.g., "Tasks for current phase not marked complete in tasks.md"]
Action: Please return to [Previous Mode] and complete necessary steps.
```
