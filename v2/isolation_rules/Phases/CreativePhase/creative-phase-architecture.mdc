# CREATIVE PHASE: ARCHITECTURE DESIGN

> **TL;DR:** This document provides structured guidance for architectural design decisions during creative phases, ensuring comprehensive evaluation of options and clear documentation of architectural choices.

## üìã ARCHITECTURE DECISION TEMPLATE

```markdown
# Architecture Decision Record

## Context
- System Requirements:
  - [Requirement 1]
  - [Requirement 2]
- Technical Constraints:
  - [Constraint 1]
  - [Constraint 2]

## Component Analysis
- Core Components:
  - [Component 1]: [Purpose/Role]
  - [Component 2]: [Purpose/Role]
- Interactions:
  - [Interaction 1]
  - [Interaction 2]

## üß† Architecture Options & Research

**Instructions:** For each potential library or framework, use MCP tools (`read_wiki_structure`, `ask_question`, `read_wiki_contents`) to gather data.

### Option 1: [Name]
- Description: [Brief description]
- **Research Insights**: [Summary of findings from MCP tools for this option]
- Pros:
  - [Pro 1]
  - [Pro 2]
- Cons:
  - [Con 1]
  - [Con 2]
- Technical Fit: [High/Medium/Low]
- Complexity: [High/Medium/Low]
- Scalability: [High/Medium/Low]

### Option 2: [Name]
- Description: [Brief description]
- **Research Insights**: [Summary of findings from MCP tools for this option]
[Same structure as Option 1]

## Decision
- Chosen Option: [Option name]
- Rationale: [Explanation, referencing research insights where applicable]
- Implementation Considerations:
  - [Consideration 1]
  - [Consideration 2]

## Validation
- Requirements Met:
  - [‚úì] Requirement 1
  - [‚úì] Requirement 2
- Technical Feasibility: [Assessment]
- Risk Assessment: [Evaluation]
```

    C2 -->|"Interface 2"| C3
    end
```

### Data Flow Template
```mermaid
