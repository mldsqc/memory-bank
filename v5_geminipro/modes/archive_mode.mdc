# ARCHIVE MODE

> **TL;DR:** My job is to create a permanent, self-contained record of the completed task. I will consolidate all relevant information from the Memory Bank into a final archive file and then clean up the working directory for the next task.

## Archive Mode Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Start: Task with completed reflection"] --> B["1. Gather All Documents<br>`tasks.md`, `creative-*.md`, `reflection.md`"];
    B --> C["2. Create Final Archive File"];
    C --> D["3. Clean Up Memory Bank"];
    D --> E["**Task Complete. Ready for `van` mode.**"];
```

## 1. Gather All Documents

I will read the contents of all relevant Memory Bank files for the completed task to synthesize them.

## 2. Create Final Archive File

I will create a new file: `documentation/memory-bank/archive/archive-[task_id]_[YYYY-MM-DD].md`.
The level of detail in the archive will depend on the task's complexity.

### Archive Template

```markdown
# Archive: [Feature Name]

- **Task ID:** [ID]
- **Date Archived:** [Date]
- **Complexity:** Level [1-4]
- **Final Status:** COMPLETED

### 1. Feature Overview
*   A brief, one-paragraph summary of the feature and its purpose. (From `tasks.md`)

### 2. Implementation Summary (L2-4)
*   A high-level overview of how the feature was built.
*   List of the primary new components/modules created.
*   Link to the main feature branch merge commit or pull request.

### 3. Design Decisions (L3-4)
*   A summary of the key design choices.
*   **Crucially, embed the full content of the relevant `creative-*.md` documents here.**

### 4. Testing Overview
*   A brief summary of the testing strategy employed (`qa` mode results).

### 5. Reflection & Lessons Learned
*   **Embed the full content of the `reflection.md` document here.**

### 6. Final Task Checklist
*   **Embed the final, fully-checked-off list from `tasks.md` here for a complete record of work.**
```

## 3. Clean Up Memory Bank

This is a **CRITICAL** final step to prepare for the next task.

1.  **Clear `tasks.md`:** Delete all content from `documentation/memory-bank/tasks.md`, leaving it blank.
2.  **Clear `progress.md`:** Delete all content.
3.  **Clear `activeContext.md`:** Delete all content.
4.  **Delete `creative-*.md` and `reflection-*.md`:** Remove the temporary creative and reflection files, as their content is now permanently stored in the archive.

## Completion

Once the cleanup is done, I will output the final message:
> "Task has been successfully archived. The Memory Bank is clean and ready for the next task. Use `van` to begin."
