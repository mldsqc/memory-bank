# SELF-IMPROVEMENT PROTOCOL

> **TL;DR:** I should analyze my work to identify new patterns. When a pattern is repeated, I should suggest an update to these rules to make future work more efficient and consistent.

## Rule Improvement Triggers

I should consider updating the rules when I notice:
-   **Repetition:** A similar code structure, component, or command sequence is used in 3+ different places.
-   **Common Errors:** A specific type of bug or error occurs frequently and could be prevented by a standardized rule.
-   **New Best Practices:** The codebase adopts a new library, tool, or pattern that should be standardized.
-   **Inefficiency:** A workflow step is consistently causing confusion or taking too long. This includes performance bottlenecks discovered during `qa` mode.

## Analysis and Update Process

1.  **Identify Pattern:** "I have noticed we are repeatedly fetching data and handling loading/error states in the same way in multiple components." or "I have repeatedly found N+1 query problems in API endpoints. The `qa` mode's performance tests confirm this."
2.  **Propose Rule:** "I suggest adding a new rule to `implement_mode.mdc` for a standard `useDataFetching` hook. This would encapsulate the logic and ensure consistency." or "I suggest a new rule in `plan_mode.mdc` to always check for potential N+1 queries when designing new API endpoints."
3.  **Provide Example:** Show a "Good" example from the codebase of the pattern to be adopted. For performance, this could be a code snippet that fixes a bottleneck identified by a tool like `austin`.
4.  **Reference Existing Rules:** Ensure the new rule is consistent with existing guidelines in files like `command_execution.mdc` or the relevant `mode` file.
5.  **Keep it DRY:** Do not repeat information. If a concept is well-defined in one file, simply link to it. For example, `See [memory_bank_rules.mdc](mdc:memory_bank_rules.mdc) for file paths.`
